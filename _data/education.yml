  summary: My work during graduate phase is centered around solving complex differential equations using numerical methods. The problem I took on for my master's research was to understand fluid flow around a body using immersed boundary method techniques. The crux of my thesis is based on using k-means clustering model to predict flow variants like pressure, velocity, etc. This model is trained and tested with data derived from performing real-world experiments. With inherent interest in programming, I started to work in software engineering graduation.
